# INF 554 Assignment 9

## Description 
Use the countries of Assignment 1 (one year & 10 countries) to build a proportional symbol map and a choropleth map with D3 complete with labels, legend, and title.

Demonstrate good development practices:
- Document set-up & deployment in [README.md](README.md)
- Use incremental commits that are meaningful e.g. each commit adds one feature/component.
- Test that your code works before you commit.
- Do not commit files that are not related to the assignment.

Publish your work on your USC SCF account (see [SCF-HOWTO.md](SCF-HOWTO.md)) and add a link to the **published** `a9.html` in [README.md](README.md). All files, including `a9.html` should be stored in the repository. Describe the data and cite your sources in `a9.html`.
